# [Last.fm clone React App](https://lastfm-clone-react.vercel.app)

[LIVE demo](https://lastfm-clone-react.vercel.app)

This is the repository with code of my **react** app that clones some of public last.fm site features, like top chart of artists and tracks, as well as search page. It was made during frontend school at Tensor with **react** and **react router.**
